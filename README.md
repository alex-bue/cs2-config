# Counter-Strike 2 Configuration

Use the `CreateCS2Symlinks.ps1` script to symlink CS2 config files from the repository to your game's `cfg` directory.

## Setup

Run the `CreateCS2Symlinks.ps1` script with the path to your CS2 `cfg` directory (remove argument if default steam installation):
```powershell
.\CreateCS2Symlinks.ps1 -SteamPath "C:\Games\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\game\csgo\cfg"
```
